# MongoDB driven restaurant menu

<p>I got an introduction into MongoDB/Express and I wanted to create something with the new knowledge. This would never be a live application, because it isn't secure and everyone could edit. But that's something I will try to learn next.</p>
<p>I tried to imagine a practical use case of what I have learned and came up with this menu page. On this page you can add, edit or delete dishes from the menu.</p>

## Live

Because I didn't learn about authentication and deploying such website, I made a screen capture of my localhost:

## What I have learned

It was the first time creating a project with a database on my own. The main goal was to repeat what I have learned without looking at the tutorials (which I didn't have to do) and I tried to ignore the code I have written while following the introduction course. What I learned:

- More about the dialog element

- How to collect multiple items for an array with a html form

- Working with MongoDB, ExpressJS in general

## Things I may change in the future

- As I already said, there is no security implemented at all, which wouldn't be the best move :)

- Some sort of authentication, where a non-authenticated user just sees the menu. And a certain role can see the add/edit/delete functionalities

- If I add a dish it appears at the bottom of the list. It would be nice if a user could edit the order

- The input list for the array of ingredients could be better.

## Conclusion

> It was nice to discover how mongoDB works and what is possible even with limited knowledge.
