# MongoDB driven restaurant menu

<p>I got an introduction into MongoDB/Express and I wanted to create something with the new knowledge. This would never be a live application, because it isn't secure and everyone could edit. But that's something I will try to learn next.</p>
<p>I tried to imagine a practical use case of what I have learned and came up with this menu page. On this page you can add, edit or delete dishes from the menu.</p>

## Live

Because I didn't learn about authentication and deploying such website, I made a screen capture of my localhost:

## What I have learned

This was very fun project to work on and it allowed me to work with several things for the first time:

- LocalStorage

- Animations/keyframes

- Creating a custom radiobutton

- Thinking about a game mechanic

## Things I may change in the future

- Making it a bit more dynamic like adding a sort of animation when you hover over a tile

- Expanding the statistics. I don't think it will be very difficult, but I didn't want to copy Wordle too much

- When the game reveals if you win or lose it's a bit too simple

- Refactor: although it runs smooth, I think there is room to improve the code at every front: html, css and js

- Adding a favicon

## Conclusion

> This is not something I would deliver to a client, but it was a great learning process
